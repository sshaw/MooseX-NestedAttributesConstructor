=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module sets attributes from a nested data structure passed your object's constructor.
The appropriate types will be created, just add the C<NestedAttrubute> trait to attributes with
a custom or parameterized type.

Nested attributes are turned into objects after C<BUILDARGS> is called.
